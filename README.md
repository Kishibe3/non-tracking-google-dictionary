# non-tracking-google-dictionary
google embed google analytics in google dictionary, which is a tool I used a lot when encountering new words in a document. I don't like that, so I decide to recreate a google dictionary with its most useful function and without tracking.

This is a web extension created for Chromium based browsers.

For Firefox version, please visit [here](https://github.com/Kishibe3/non-tracking-google-dictionary-firefox).
