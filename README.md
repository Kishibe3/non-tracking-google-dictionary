# non-tracking-google-dictionary
google embed google analytics in google dictionary, which is a tool I used a lot when encountering new words in a document. I don't like that, so I decide to recreate a google dictionary with its most useful function and without tracking.

This is a web extension created for Chromium based browsers.

# How to use
Double click or select a word, then a bubble with translate result will show up. You can also click the extension icon to show popup page with a search bar. You can look up a word in the search bar.

# How to install

Edit the first line of "background.js" to change it to the language you want to translate to. Save the file.
